There are many locations the ruby script can live, but one option is to create a new “facts” module under the delivered modules directory. Create a folder structure similar to this:modules   └───facts         └───lib              └───facterIn this directory, create a script such as facts.rb:require 'facter'Facter.add(:application) do  setcode do    application = 'hcm'    application  endend    In these scripts you can use all sorts of logic using other facts, regex, and conditionals to create facts based upon the current environment (such as hostname, operating system, other facts, etc). This is just a small hardcoded example.Hiera and Custom FactsIn your psft_customizations.yaml file, you can reference these facts. For example, if you wanted your PIA domains to include the region in the name, the YAML would look like this:pia_domain_list:  \"peoplesoft-%{::region}\":Fact OverrideYou can also override some facts using environment variables. To override a fact, set an environment variable like $env:FACTER_factname=\"newvalue\". The environment variable must start with FACTER_.",

Here is a handy VSCode “snippet” for making this easier. If the YAML Language extension is installed (redhat.vscode-yaml), lookup will be able to autocomplete into the snippet, using tab to get inside, and then out of the hiera lookup.

        "title": "Software and Tools",
        "content": "This page is a collection of different tools that I use to make a PS Admin's job easier. Some of these are freeware or open source while others are worth paying for.## Security*   [Password Safe][1] - Free Password Safe offers excellent security for all the passwords you manage. You could memorize your passwords (ugly), keep them on a spreadsheet (bad), or use Password Safe to keep all your passwords safely encrypted. The only password you need to remember is the safe's master password. Once you open the safe, just double-click on the password you want to use and paste password. You don't even need to know the underlying passwords! Password Safe also has a good password generator feature. You can set up the password rules and let it generate them for you.*   [Keystore Explorer][2] - Free Keystore Explorer is a great tool for working with java keystore files, like `pskey`. The `pskeymanager` wrapper only offers a subset of functions for the Java `keytool` program. Keystore Explorer offers the same features as `keytool` but has a nice GUI to work with.## Server Administration*   [RDC Manager][3] - Free If you are in a Windows-heavy environment, this tools is a great way to manage all of your servers and remote connections. RDC Manager easily organizes all of your servers into groups, lets you connect to multiple RDC sessions, and saves your login credentials.*   [mRemoteNG][4] - Free remote desktop tool that supports both RDP and PuTTy SSH connections.*   [Beyond Compare][5] = $30 or $50 for Pro Beyond Compare is the best file and directory compare utility. It is incredibly fast for comparing two folder together, changing what differences you see, easily compares complex files and can synchronize folders. Beyond Compare is also scriptable, so you can take advantage of it's features on the command line.## Development*   [SublimeText][6] - Free to Try, $70 SublimeText is my favorite text editor. There are many editors to choose from, and I've tried lots, but I keep coming back to SublimeText. SublimeText has lots of plug-ins for editing and syntax highlighting, and is very responsive with large files. [Package Control][7] is a plug-in manager for SublimeText that makes it easy to install new plug-ins. Install Package Control when you open Sublime Text for the first time.*   [Visual Studio Code][17] - Free, Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs.*   [Programmer's File Editor][8] - Free PFE has almost no modern features, but it does one thing well: it opens very large text files without any issues. Do you have 1GB trace file that needs to be searched? Use PFE.*   [SQR Express][9] - $149 SQR Express is a great editor for SQR programs. The ability to run the program within the editor is wonderful and it has useful tools for writing SQR programs.*   [TraceMagic][10] - Free TraceMagic simplifies much of the information in `.tracesql` files. TraceMagic will group SQL statements, show you all the tables in the FROM clause, tables that are being Updated or Inserted. It is much easier to find the errors using TraceMagic. You will need an Oracle Support account to download; search for Doc ID `1470578.1`.*   [SQL Developer][11] - Free SQL Developer has really improved in the latest versions and I enjoy using it more than Toad. It's a great SQL tool when working on Oracle databases. Not much else to say, it's a solid tool.*   [PSChrome Extension][12] - Free For Chrome only, but this extension has features to make working in PeopleSoft easier. I really like the Auto-Refresh on the Process Scheduler page and the Field Information mode. The Auto-Refresh will select the Refresh button on the Process Scheduler page at an interval you want. It's a simple way to watch what is happening on the scheduler. The Field Information mode will let you click on any text box, button, or label on a page and it gives you the record and field name. That saves a trip to App Designer.*   [DataDumper Application Class][13] - Free The DataDumper application class let's you dump the structure and content of a PeopleCode object to file. You can even email the output so you don't have find it on the server. Import the `CHG_DataDumper` class and away you go. There is even a [great overview video on how to use the application class][14].## Documentation*   [Instiki][15] - Free I have found that wiki is the best way to keep documentation as a PS Admin. Instiki is a very simple wiki that makes it easy to create pages, link topics, and reduces the amount of work to keep documentation up-to-date. It is a light-weight wiki based on Ruby on Rails which makes it easy to run on any server.*   [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) - A cheap and powerful tool for team documentation.*   [Trello](https://trello.com/) - Trello is a Kanban board that is great for managing lists.*   [Slack][16] - Free for small teams        Slack is essentially IRC, but web-based and app-based with better features. I love using it with remote teams because it replaces the hallway discussions and creates better communication within teams.

        "content": "## Unblock Tuxedo Connection Due Failed LoginsStarting with PT 8.56 Oracle delivered a new feature with Tuexedo that will block a server if too many failed loggins occured or if Tuxedo believes it is being attatched by the server.As a default, if a client login fails three (3) times in 60 seconds, the associated IP address is blocked.If warranted for your environment, you can tune the TM_WS_MAX_FAILED_TRIAL (limit of failed login attempts) and TM_WS_ATTACK_IP_CHK_INTERVAL (time interval for failed login attempts) environment variables to allow for more login failures and/or a different, smaller interval.If you're certain that there is no actual attacker, it may consider disabling this option. You can disable it by setting the TM_WS_MAX_FAILED_TRIAL environment variable to 0 (TM_WS_MAX_FAILED_TRIAL=0).The limit on failed login attempts is a security mechanism to protect against a client guessing a password.Changing the values of these environment variables is done at your own risk.These log errors are in the TUXLOG log files.To view current blocked connections```powershellcd $env:PS_CFG_HOME$env:TUXCONFIG=\"${env:PS_CFG_HOME}\\appserv\\>\\PSTUXCFG\"cmd /c tmadmbclist -l```To unblock a specifed ip address run the following  ```powershellcd $env:PS_CFG_HOME$env:TUXCONFIG=\"${env:PS_CFG_HOME}\\appserv\\>\\PSTUXCFG\"cmd /c tmadmbclist -b >```",

To achieve that, use  `Set-Service` command, e.g.```powershell# Set All PeopleSoft Services to manual startupGet-Service *psft* | Set-Service –StartupType 'Manual'```## Delete ServicesSince there is no `delete-service` cmdlet, use this command to delete services by name. For each service that contains \"psft\", loop through the services and delete them.```powershell Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Where-Object { $_.name -like 'Psft*' } | % { $_.delete() }```You can also drop into a Windows Command Shell or PowerShell and use `sc.exe` to delete a service.```powershellsc.exe delete PsftAppServerDomainAPPDOMService```",
